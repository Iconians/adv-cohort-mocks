# Mock Interview Practice Guide

## Overview
This document contains five mock interview sets, each designed to be completed in **one hour**. Each set consists of either **two medium problems** or **two easy and one medium problem**, mirroring a real junior/mid-level technical interview.

## How to Use This Guide
1. **Time Yourself:** Treat each mock session as a real interview. Allocate exactly **one hour** per session.
2. **No Peeking at Solutions:** Try to solve each problem **without looking up the solution**. If you get stuck, take a structured approach:
   - Clarify the problem.
   - Think through brute force approaches.
   - Optimize step by step.
3. **Code in a Whiteboard-Style Manner:** Avoid running the code immediately. Instead, walk through your logic as if explaining it to an interviewer.
4. **Review Your Solutions:** After completing the session, compare your approach to an optimal solution.
5. **Practice Similar Problems:** If a problem was challenging, find and solve **3-5 similar problems** to reinforce the concept.

## Mock Interview Sets
Each interview covers different topics, ensuring well-rounded preparation. Problems focus on:
- Arrays & Strings
- Recursion & Backtracking
- Stacks, Queues, and Linked Lists
- Binary Search Trees & Greedy Algorithms
- Mixed Concepts

Happy coding and good luck with your interviews!
